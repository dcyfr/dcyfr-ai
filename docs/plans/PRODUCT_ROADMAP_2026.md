# DCYFR AI Product Roadmap 2026

**Information Classification:** TLP:AMBER (Limited Distribution)  
**Created:** February 5, 2026  
**Status:** Planning  
**Owner:** DCYFR Core Team  
**Package:** @dcyfr/ai

---

## Vision

Transform DCYFR AI from a CLI-centric agent framework into a **multi-interface, always-on personal AI platform** — enterprise-grade, developer-first, and security-native.

Inspired by the OpenClaw movement but differentiated through enterprise security (TLP, OWASP, audit trails), professional developer workflows, and multi-project orchestration.

---

## Quarterly Roadmap

### Q1 2026 — Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Theme:** *"Always-on, always-aware"*

#### P0 — Persistent Memory System
**Effort:** 3–4 weeks · **Package:** `@dcyfr/ai`

- [ ] Vector database integration (local embeddings via SQLite-vec or LanceDB)
- [ ] Structured preference storage (user conventions, coding style, project context)
- [ ] Session history that survives restarts
- [ ] Memory scoping: per-user, per-project, per-workspace
- [ ] TLP-classified memory (sensitive context flagged and encrypted at rest)
- [ ] Memory APIs: `agent.remember()`, `agent.recall()`, `agent.forget()`

**Success Criteria:**
- Agent recalls user preferences across sessions
- Memory persists through process restart
- Sensitive data encrypted, non-sensitive data searchable

---

#### P0 — Multi-Agent Orchestration Protocol
**Effort:** 4–5 weeks · **Package:** `@dcyfr/ai`

- [ ] Agent-to-agent communication protocol (message passing)
- [ ] Shared context bus for collaborative tasks
- [ ] Agent delegation and handoff patterns
- [ ] Supervisor agent pattern (orchestrator manages specialist agents)
- [ ] Concurrent execution with dependency resolution
- [ ] Progress aggregation across agent swarm

**Example Flow:**
```
User: "Review this PR for security and performance"
  → Orchestrator spawns:
    → SecurityAgent: scans for vulnerabilities
    → PerformanceAgent: profiles critical paths
    → TestAgent: verifies coverage
  → Orchestrator aggregates findings into unified report
```

**Success Criteria:**
- 3+ agents collaborating on a single task
- Shared context without data duplication
- Clean handoff protocol documented and tested

---

- [ ] Retry policies with exponential backoff
- [ ] Task history and audit log

**Success Criteria:**
- Long-running tasks (10+ minutes) complete reliably
- User receives progress updates without polling
- Failed tasks recoverable from checkpoint

---

#### P1 — Proactive Heartbeat System
